<p>Hi BBC community, i want you to present my </p><h1>newest ideas</h1>

<h2>1. Step 4</h2>
<p>Since we are having a step3 games every 2 or 3 weeks, maybe its time to create a step4.
Of course this would be a great change, it would require some coding for the website too.
It raises some questions, so here are some suggested variants, how to deal with rules etc.
</p>
<h3>1.1 Blind Settings</h3>
<p>
What blind settings should we use for step4? Should we change step3 blind settings then?<br>
<b>Variant 1:</b> Both step3 and step4 will have the same blind settings as the current step 3<br>
<b>Variant 2:</b> the new step3 games have the same blind settings, except with 8000 as start cash, so it is a bit faster. step4 like current step3<br>
<b>Variant 3:</b> the new step3 games have the same blind settings, except with 7000 as start cash, so it is a bit faster. step4 like current step3<br>
</p>
<h3>1.2 Ticket rules for new step3 games</h3>
<p>
<b>Variant 1</b>: in a step3 game place 1,2,3 get ts4 and everyone looses ts3<br>
<b>Variant 2</b>: in a step3 game place 1,2 get ts4 and everyone looses ts3<br>
<b>Variant 3</b>: in a step3 game place 1,2 get ts4, place 3 can keep his ts3, places 1,2,4,5,...10 loose ts3<br>
<h3>1.3 Ticket rules for old step3 games</h3>
<b>Variant 1</b>: Noone gets a ts4 for games in the past<br>
<b>Variant 2</b>: The winners of step3 games in the past get a ts4
<p>If we take variant 2, we would not need to wait too long for the first step4 game. otherwise it may take some months.</p>

<h3>1.4 Ticket rules for step4 games</h3>
<p> (i would prefer variant 1 on this one)<br>
<b>Variant 1</b>: like in the current step3, everyone looses their ticket if they play.<br>
<b>Variant 2</b>: players wich are successful in step4 (e.g. winner only) can keep their ts4<br>
<b>Variant 3</b>: players wich are successful in step4 (e.g. winner only) get ts3 as a price<br>
</p>
<h3>1.5. Awards</h3>
<p>I would suggest that in the future, step3 winners get no awards, but the step4 winner does.</p>
<?php
//<b> Variant 1</b>: in the future, only the step4 winners get an award<br>
 //<b> Variant 2</b>: step3 winners keep getting awards, and place 1-3 in step4 get awards-->
?>
<h3>1.6. Definition of "season"</h3>
<p>
<b>Variant 1</b>: If we have a bbc step4, a bbc season should end with a step4 game.<br>
<b>Variant 2</b>: As before, a season should end with a step3 game.<br>
I would prefer variant 1, since seasons have become too short. Also it makes more sence to be BBC King (or BBC Ace ;) ) for one season and not 6 seasons.
</p>
<h3>1.7. Date for step 3</h3>
<p>
<b>Variant 1</b>: We fix the date for step3 and play it every 3 weeks<br>
<b>Variant 2</b>: We fix the date for step3 and play it every 2 weeks, if there are enough players<br>
<b>Variant 3</b>: We keep the flexible method for step3 like it is<br>
About Variant 2: I think if we do it every two weeks, it can occur that there are not enough players for step3. but for me that is not a big problem, we simply play the next step3 games two weeks later. So if there are not enough players we have 4 weeks between two step3 games.
</p>
<h3>1.8. Date for step 4</h3>
<p>I would suggest that we keep the date for the future step4 flexible, like we it do with the current step3. 
Further i would suggest to play the step4 on a saturday at 19:30.<br>
We also have to think about how often there will be a step4 game. That depends on the Choices we make for ticket rules and dates for step3.
I think it could be 3-5 months</p>
<h3>1.9. Ranking</h3>
<p>If we have a step4, i would suggest that we have to change the weighting for the different steps. Current weights are 1,2,4 for the steps 1,2,3<br>
Please have in mind that it may also be relevant what we do with the Rating (see 2.)<br>
<b>Variant 1</b>: The steps get weightet with 1,2,3,4<br>
<b>Variant 2</b>: The steps get weightet with 2,3,4,6<br>
<b>Variant 3</b>: The steps get weightet with 1,2,4,0 for old games and 1,2,3,4 for new games<br>
I dont like variant 3, but it would have the advantage that the old rankings would stay exactly the same.

</p>
<h2>2. Rating</h2>
<p>Yes, that is not a very new idea, i just have been lazy back then... but maybe i'll give it a try soon</p>
